Comp Graphics and Visualization

-How do I approach designing software?
I try to approach design with a plan. I want to have a lay out of what need to be develop and try to work on the stepping stones to complete it. 

-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I've learned there is a large community that is always willing to help. Utilizing peers is a good tool to have to help me in this craft.

-What design process did you follow for your project work?
There was a method to my chaos. I like to think. I know a skill I need to work on is ensure the code is orginized and easy to read.

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This is a lesson learned and I know how to be more effective when it comes to designing and developing code.

-How do I approach developing programs?
I like to use stepping stones in order to reach the over all goal. What steps do I need to take to accomplish the over all picture. 

-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Being more orginized. I attempted to regardless. Sometimes I felt like I was doing well but other times it felt like the code was a mess. It is a skill that does need to be developed and I am working on it. 

-How did iteration factor into your development?
I did enjoy it, I like having steps and small goals to reach in order to accomplish the bigger picture. I already implenet that in my life and it was easy to do for this project.

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Reading over the supportive matterial was helpful. I'm glad each milestone was accomplishing specific goals and they each built onto them. 

-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My ultimate goal is to commission as an officer in the armed forces. I'm hoping the skills I gain in the program will help me with these goals.

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I'm not entirely sure but it was a fun course. It gave me some personal goals I would like to try to accomplish. 

-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I allowed me to find my shortcomings and try to find goals to fix my shortcomings. It is important for code to be orginized and I'm trying to do better.
